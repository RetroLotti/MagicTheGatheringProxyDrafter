# RetroLottis Magic: The Gathering - Proxy Drafter aka MgcPrxyDrftr
I wrote this console application to create ready to print PDF files of Magic: The Gathering booster packs.
Highly inspired by [MtGen](https://github.com/copperdogma/mtgen) I figured that I'd like to create a booster pack for printing and using the cards in proxy drafting.
Data is base on two main sources:
- [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)
- [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/)

<strike>PDF files are generated via [nanDeck](https://www.nandeck.com/).</strike>
PDF files are now generated using [FreeSpire.PDF](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FreeSpire.PDF).
There are limitations to the free version but at the moment these do not apply to my case.
