# RetroLottis MagicTheGatheringProxyDrafter
I wrote this console application to create ready to print PDF files of Magic: The Gathering booster packs.
Base for everything are two main sources:
- [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)
- [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/)

PDF files are generated via [nanDeck](https://www.nandeck.com/).
