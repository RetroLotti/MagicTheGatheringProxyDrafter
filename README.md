# RetroLottis Magic: The Gathering - Proxy Drafter aka MgcPrxyDrftr
I wrote this console application to create ready to print PDF files of Magic: The Gathering booster packs.
Highly inspired by [MtGen](https://github.com/copperdogma/mtgen) I figured that I'd like to create a booster pack for printing and using the cards in proxy drafting.
Data is base on two main sources:
- [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)
- [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/)

PDF files are generated via [nanDeck](https://www.nandeck.com/).

I'd like to use a free build in PDF-File creator but as of now I was not willing to do so :D

As I started to compare generated sets with real sets and those generated by "Magic: The Gathering: Sealed Deck Card Generator" I started to realise that my boosters are missing art, token and other special cards.
My current goal is to make the booster more accurate as well as print predefined decks and also just lists from the clipboard.
